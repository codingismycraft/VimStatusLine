# VimStatusLine

VimStatusLine is a vim plugin to add a simple but effective status line
that is also git aware displaying the branch name and information about
the status of the currently active file. 


## Installation
The preferred method of installation is using Vundle. However, other plugin
installers should work fine as well (although they have not been tested). To
install using Vundle, add the following lines to your .vimrc file:

```
call vundle#begin()
Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'
Plugin 'codingismycraft/VimStatusLine'
call vundle#end()
```
